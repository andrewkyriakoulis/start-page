# Simple Start/New Tab Page

This page is a replica of the Firefox new tab page. I rebuilt a simple version of it so I could better control the icons and eventually add more features.

## To do:
1. Add vendor prefixes to CSS
2. Add more icons

## Firefox:
Without an add-on, Firefox no longer natively allows custom files/URLs for new tabs. However, they _are_ allowed as your home page.

So, you can set your new tabs to open a blank page, set the `start.html` file location as a custom URL for the home page, and use the keyboard shortcut to open it when you need to.

**Windows:** Alt + Home

**Mac:** Option + FN + Left Arrow
